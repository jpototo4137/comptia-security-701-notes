> **Identification → Analysis → Response → Validation → Reporting**

---

## Identification Methods

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Detects: **buffer overflows, database injections**  
- Cannot detect: **auth security, insecure cryptography**  
- Must verify findings → **false positives** common  

### Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing)
- Send random input to app → watch for **crash, errors, exceptions**  
- Types: fault-injection, robustness, syntax, negative testing  
- **Fuzzing engines & frameworks**:  
  - Platform or language specific  
  - **Resource heavy** (CPU, time) → many use probability tests  
  - Example: **CERT Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF)**  

### Package Monitoring
- Confirm **legitimacy** of packages:  
  - Trusted source  
  - No added malware / vulnerabilities  
  - Contents verified  

### Threat Intelligence
#### OSINT (Open-source Intelligence)
- Public sources: Internet, social media, govt data, reports  

#### Proprietary / Third-Party
- Purchased intelligence services  
- Correlate threat data across sources  
- Automated prevention workflows  

#### Information-Sharing Orgs
- Public intel (sometimes classified)  
- Private intel (industry groups, e.g. **Cyber Threat Alliance**)  
  - Members share validated, scored threat data  

#### Dark Web Intelligence
- Monitor hacker forums/markets:  
  - Tools/techniques, credit card sales, stolen acc/pw  
  - Good for checking if your org is being targeted  

### Penetration Testing
- Simulates **real attack** (unlike vuln scan which only detects)  
- Often compliance mandated  

**Cautions**  
- May cause **DoS / data loss** if misused  
- Exploits: brute-force, social engineering, injection, buffer overflow  

#### Rules of Engagement
- Defines **scope & purpose**:  
  - Testing type (internal, external, physical, after hours)  
  - Rules (IP ranges, handling sensitive info, in/out-of-scope devices)  

#### Process
- **Initial exploitation** → entry point  
- **Lateral movement** → jump between systems  
- **Persistence** → backdoors, default pw changes, user creation  
- **Pivot point** → compromised system as proxy  

#### Responsible Disclosure
- Report vulnerabilities → vendor fixes  
- **Bug bounty programs** incentivize disclosure

## Analysis

### False Positives vs False Negatives
- **False positive** → flagged vuln doesn’t exist  
- **False negative** → vuln exists but wasn’t detected  
- Keep tools updated (signatures, DB).  

### Prioritization
- **Severity ranking**: High > Medium > Low  
- **CVSS** → score 0–10 (v2 vs v3.x differences)  
- **CVE** → known vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2020-1889)  
  - Apps, web apps, network misconfigs  

### Exposure Factor
- % impact: e.g. DDoS = 50% service loss, buffer overflow = 100% loss  

### Environmental Variables
- Internal vs external, public vs test environment  
- Patching frequency depends on user type, revenue apps  

### Org Impact & Risk Tolerance
- Org type influences severity  
- Risk tolerance defines **patch timing**  
- Testing introduces exposure window  

**Cheatsheet – Analysis**

| **Concept** | **Definition** | **Exam Trap** |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| False Positive | Vuln flagged but not real | Over-reporting |
| False Negative | Vuln exists but missed | Blind spot |
| CVSS | Quantitative 0–10 score | Version v2 vs v3 |
| CVE | Specific vuln ID | Applies across scans |
| Exposure Factor | % service loss | 50% vs 100% |
| Risk Tolerance | Patch timing acceptable | Depends on severity |

---

## Vulnerability Response & Remediation

### Patching
- **Most common mitigation**  
- Scheduled (monthly, quarterly)  
- Unscheduled (zero-day, urgent)  

### Insurance
- Cyber coverage may include: lost revenue, data recovery, phishing losses, privacy lawsuits  
- Not comprehensive; ransomware coverage growing  

### Segmentation
- Limit exploit scope  
- **Air gap** → if can’t patch, disconnect from world  
- Internal **NGFWs**: block traffic, detect malicious flows  

### Physical vs Logical Segmentation
- **Physical** → separate devices/infrastructure  
- **Logical (VLANs)** → segmented on same device, requires router (L3) to communicate  

### Compensating Controls
- Alternative measures when patch unavailable:  
  - Disable service  
  - Revoke access  
  - Limit external use  
  - Modify internal controls, software firewalls  

**Cheatsheet – Response**

| **Technique** | **Purpose** | **Exam Trap** |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Patching | Fix vuln directly | Zero-day urgent |
| Insurance | Offset financial loss | Limited coverage |
| Segmentation | Limit attack scope | VLANs need L3 device |
| Air Gap | Isolation when no patch | ICS/SCADA |
| Comp Controls | Temporary protection | Disable service |

---

## Validation of Remediation

### Exceptions & Exemptions
- Balance between service availability vs patching risk  
- Some vulns less severe → delayed fixes  

### Validation Process
- Confirm patch effectiveness  
- Verify all vulnerable systems patched  
- **Rescan** after patch  
- **Audit & verification**  

---

## Reporting
- Continuous checks needed → vulns always emerging  
- **Automation essential** (manual too time-consuming)  
- Reporting includes:  
  - # identified vulns  
  - Patched vs unpatched systems  
  - New threat notifications  
  - Errors, exceptions, exemptions

## Monitoring Computing Resources

### Systems
- **Authentication** → logins from strange places  
- **Server monitoring** → service activities, backups, software versions  

### Applications
- **Availability** → uptime & response times  
- **Data transfers** → spikes or drops in traffic  
- **Security notifications** → from devs/vendors  

### Infrastructure
- **Remote access systems** → employees, vendors, guests

- **Centralized reporting**  
- **Correlation across systems** → auth, app access, data transfer monitoring  

### Alerting
- Real-time notification (e.g., large file transfers, repeated login failures)  
- **Actionable data** → quick response  
- Delivery methods: SMS, email, console, SOC  

### Scanning
- Continuous scan of: OS type/versions, drivers, anomalies  

### Reporting
- **Actionable reports** → compliance status, outdated OS, devices  
- **Ad hoc analysis** (“what-if” scenarios, future predictions)  

### Archiving
- Breach identification average: ~9 months  
- May be mandated by law/org requirements  

### Alert Response & Remediation
- **Quarantine** → isolate suspected system  
- **Alert tuning** → balance between false positives & false negatives  

**Cheatsheet – Monitoring Activities**

---

## Security Tools

### SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)
- Managed by **NIST**  
- Shared between tools → config compliance, vuln detection  
- **Automation**: ongoing monitoring, alerting, remediation  
- Useful in large environments  

### Benchmarks
- Best practice security configs (e.g. **CIS Benchmarks**)  
- Baseline = bare minimum  

### Agents vs Agentless
- **Agents**:  
  - Installed software  
  - Real-time monitoring & notifications  
  - Must be maintained & updated  
- **Agentless**:  
  - One-time/on-demand checks  
  - No ongoing monitoring  
  - No alerts if not running  

### SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)
- Logs security events & alerts  
- Real-time log collection & aggregation  
- Long-term storage & reporting  
- **Correlation** → link diverse data types  
- **Forensics** → detailed post-event analysis  

### Antivirus & Anti-malware
- **Antivirus** → originally focused on viruses (trojans, worms, macros)  
- **Anti-malware** → broader category (spyware, ransomware, fileless)  
- Modern tools = combined capabilities  

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Prevent **data leakage** before attacker access  
- Multi-solution approach: endpoint clients + cloud-based (email, storage, collaboration)  

### SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
- Uses **MIB (Management Information Base)** + OIDs  
- **Polling** over UDP/161 → request device stats  
- Creates **historical performance graphs**  
- **SNMP traps** over UDP/162:  
  - Set thresholds → device sends trap when exceeded  

### NetFlow
- **Probe + collector** model  
- Probe watches comms → summary sent to collector  
- Used for network traffic analysis  

### Vulnerability Scanners
- Minimally invasive (unlike pentests)  
- Port scans, system identification  
- Test both **internal and external**  

**Cheatsheet – Security Tools**

| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Exam Trap** |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| SCAP | Config compliance automation | NIST-managed |
| Benchmarks | Security baselines (CIS) | Bare minimum |

## Firewall

**How it works:**  
- Inspects traffic → allows or blocks based on rules.  
- Works at different OSI layers depending on type.  

**Best use:**  
- First line of defense at **network perimeter**.  

### Types
- **Traditional firewall**  
  - Rules based on **port numbers + protocols** (TCP/UDP).  

- **Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW)**  
  - Exam Trap: **When to use?** → when you need **app-level inspection** (Layer 7).  
  - Looks beyond ports → inspects **application data itself**.  
  - AKA: Application layer gateway / Stateful multilayer inspection / Deep packet inspection (DPI).  

**Comparison**  
| **Type** | **How it works** | **When to use** |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| Traditional | Port + protocol only | Simple traffic filtering |
| NGFW | Inspects apps/data | Detect malware, evasion, complex attacks |

---

### Ports & Protocols
- Firewalls often filter based on **destination port + protocol**.  
- Common ones:  
  - HTTP = TCP/80, HTTPS = TCP/443  
  - SSH = TCP/22  
  - RDP = TCP/3389  
  - DNS = UDP/53  
  - NTP = UDP/123  

### Firewall Rules
- Evaluated **top → bottom**.  
- Always end with **implicit deny** (anything not matched = blocked).  
- **ACL (Access Control List)**: allows/denies traffic by:  
  - Source IP, destination IP  
  - Port number  
  - Time of day  
  - Application  

### Screened Subnet (DMZ)
- Middle zone between private/internal and public internet.  
- Public resources (e.g., web servers) are accessible, private remain hidden.  

---

## IDS / IPS

- **IDS (Intrusion Detection System)** = detects only, alerts.  
- **IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)** = actively blocks malicious traffic.  
- Often integrated into NGFW.  

**Detection methods**:  
- **Signature-based**: looks for exact match of known bad patterns.  
- **Anomaly-based**: builds baseline of normal → flags deviations.  

**Exam Trigger:**  
- If question says *“alert but don’t block”* → IDS.  
- If *“automatically stop/block”* → IPS.  

---

## Web Filtering

- **Content filtering**: block inappropriate/malicious websites.  
- **URL scanning**: allow/block lists, categories.  
- **Agent-based filters**: client software on user device.  
- **Proxies**: sits between user & internet, can cache/filter/log traffic.  
- **Block rules**: filter specific URLs or categories.  
- **Reputation filtering**: blocks based on automated/manual “risk score.”  
- **DNS filtering**: checks site reputation before DNS resolves → user never gets IP for bad sites.  

**Connections**  
- NGFW often integrates **URL filtering + proxies + DNS filtering**.  

---

## Operating System Security

### Active Directory (AD)
- Centralized database of users, groups, resources.  
- Used for **authentication + access control**.  
- Help desk common tasks: reset pw, add/remove users.  

### Group Policy
- Central console to enforce settings.  
- Examples: login scripts, QoS, security params.  

### SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux)
- Adds **Mandatory Access Control (MAC)** to Linux kernel.  
- Traditional Linux = DAC (users control access).  
- **SELinux = stricter, least privilege**.  
- Open source.  

---

## Implementation of Secure Protocols

### Unencrypted Data
- **Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP** → insecure.  
- Visible in packet capture.  

### Secure Protocol Selection
- Always use secure versions (usually with “S”):  
  - Telnet → SSH  
  - HTTP → HTTPS  
  - IMAP → IMAPS  
  - FTP → SFTP  

### Port Selection
- Secure vs insecure often use different ports (HTTP 80 vs HTTPS 443).  
- But port ≠ guarantee of encryption → need packet capture to confirm.  

### Transport Methods
- **Open Wi-Fi (802.11)** = unencrypted.  
- **WPA3** = encrypted per-user data.  
- **VPN tunnels** = create encrypted channel.  

---

## Email Security

### Mail Gateway
- Similar to firewall for mail. Screens spam/malware.  

### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
- DNS TXT record lists **authorized mail servers** for a domain.  
- Receiving mail server checks source IP against list.  

### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
- Outgoing mail digitally signed with private key.  
- Public key published in DNS TXT record.  

### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, Conformance)
- **Yes** → deals with **spam + spoofing**.  
- Combines SPF + DKIM results.  
- Lets domain owners specify **what to do if SPF/DKIM fails** (reject, quarantine, accept).  
- Sends compliance reports to admins.  

**Comparison Table**
| **Protocol** | **What it does** | **Exam Trigger** |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| SPF | Authorizes mail servers | Checks “who can send” |
| DKIM | Digital signature | Checks “message not altered” |
| DMARC | Policy + reporting | Decides what to do if SPF/DKIM fails |

---

## Monitoring Data

### File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)
- Detects unauthorized file changes.  
- Tools: **SFC (Windows)**, **Tripwire (Linux)**, HIPS.  

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Stops sensitive data from leaving environment.  
- **Types**:  
  - Data in use (PC/endpoint)  
  - Data in motion (network)  
  - Data at rest (server/storage)  
- Examples:  
  - **USB blocking** (workstation).  
  - **Cloud DLP** (block strings, URLs, malware).  
  - **Email DLP** (block sensitive inbound/outbound data).  

---

## Network Access Control (NAC)

- **Edge control** = firewall at perimeter.  
- **Access control** = per-user/device flexibility.  

### Posture Assessment (what it is)
- A **health check** before device joins network.  
- Checks for: malware, missing AV, outdated patches.  

**Methods**  
- **Persistent agent**: installed, always updated.  
- **Dissolvable agent**: temporary, runs during check, disappears.  
- **Agentless NAC**: AD-integrated, checks only at login/logoff.  

**Failing the Check**  
- Device placed in **quarantine VLAN/network** until fixed.  

---

## Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR / XDR)

### EDR
- Uses **lightweight agent** on endpoint.  
- Detect threats: signatures + behavior + ML.  
- Investigate: root cause analysis.  
- Respond: isolate, quarantine, rollback.  

### XDR (Extended Detection & Response)
- **Yes** → stands for **Extended**.  
- Builds on EDR.  
- Correlates **endpoint + network + cloud** data.  
- Improves detection rates, reduces false positives, simplifies investigations.  

**Exam Trigger**  
- If question says **“endpoint only”** → EDR.  
- If says **“includes network + cloud correlation”** → XDR.  

---

## User Behavior Analytics (UBA)

- Often part of XDR.  
- Tracks **users, hosts, network traffic, data repos**.  
- Detects unusual behavior in real time → catch insider threats/compromises early.  

---

# Connections & Relationships

- **Firewall vs IDS/IPS vs Web filtering**  
  - Firewall = blocks by ports/protocol/apps.  
  - IDS/IPS = detects or blocks malicious traffic.  
  - Web filtering/DNS filtering = controls web access.  

- **Email security (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)** → prevents spoofing & phishing.  

- **NAC (pre-connect health check)** → ensures only compliant devices join.  
  - Works with **firewall/ACLs** to enforce.  

- **FIM/DLP** → ensure file & data integrity, prevent leaks.  

- **EDR vs XDR vs UBA**  
  - EDR = endpoint detection only.  
  - XDR = endpoint + network + cloud correlation.  
  - UBA = anomaly detection, often part of XDR.  

---

# Exam Triggers Quick Recall – Modify Capabilities (4.5)

- **Traditional firewall** = port/protocol.  
- **NGFW** = application-level, DPI.  
- **ACL rules** = top-to-bottom, implicit deny.  
- **Screened subnet (DMZ)** = public access zone.  
- **IDS vs IPS** = detect vs block.  
- **Signature vs anomaly-based** detection.  
- **URL filter / DNS filter** = web restrictions.  
- **Active Directory** = centralized authentication.  
- **Group Policy** = enforce configs/security params.  
- **SELinux** = MAC in Linux.  
- **Insecure vs Secure protocols** = Telnet→SSH, HTTP→HTTPS, IMAP→IMAPS, FTP→SFTP.  
- **SPF/DKIM/DMARC** = email security trio.  
- **FIM** = file monitoring (SFC, Tripwire).  
- **DLP** = data in use, motion, rest; includes USB, cloud, email.  
- **NAC posture check** = persistent/dissolvable/agentless → quarantine failures.  
- **EDR** = endpoint only; **XDR** = endpoint + network + cloud.  
- **UBA** = anomaly detection via user behavior.  



## 4.6 Identity and Access Management 

---

### IAM (Identity and Access Management)

- Identity lifecycle management: every entity (human/non-human) gets a digital identity 
- Access control
- Authentication & Authorization
- Identity governance: track an entity's resource access

#### Provisioning / De-provisioning user accounts
- User account creation/removal
- Account details

#### Goal of IAM
1. **Permission assignments**
   - Each entity gets limited permissions (group assignments)
   - Private storage and files to that specific user
   - No privileged access to the OS
2. **Identity proofing**
   - Validation
   - Verification / Attestation

---

### SSO (Single Sign-On)
- Provide credentials once to gain access to multiple resources
- Usually time-limited (e.g., 24 hours, then re-authenticate)

---

### LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- Protocol for reading and writing directories over an IP network
- X.500 specification written by ITU
- DAP originally ran on the OSI protocol stack  
  → LDAP is the protocol used to query/update an X.500 directory  
  (used in Windows Active Directory, Apple Open Directory, Novell eDirectory)

#### X.500 Distinguished Names
- Attribute = value pairs
- Most specific attribute is listed first  
  Example: `CN = widget web, OU = marketing, O = widget`

#### X.500 Directory Information Tree
- Hierarchical structure (tree)
  - Container objects: country, organization, org units
  - Leaf objects: users, computers, printers, files

---

### SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language)
- Open standard for authentication and authorization
- Allows authentication via a third-party with one standard
- **Cons**: not originally designed for mobile apps

---

### OAuth / OpenID Connect
- **OAuth**: Authorization framework (what resources a user can access)  
  *Not an authentication protocol*  
- **OpenID Connect**: Adds authentication (SSO), e.g. Google login

---

### Federation
- Provide network access across different organizations
- Third-party establishes a federated framework to authenticate & authorize  
  (e.g., Login with Facebook / Google / other apps)

#### Interoperability
- Often depends on environment
  - VPN concentrator talks to LDAP server
  - New app uses OAuth → need authentication API access
- Part of a larger IAM strategy

---

### Access Control Models

#### Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- Used in highly secure areas
- OS limits operations based on **security clearance levels**
- Objects get labels → predefined rules
- Admin decides who gets what clearance
- Users cannot change settings

#### Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- Used in most OSs
- **Owner controls access**
- Owner can modify permissions at any time
- Flexible but weaker security

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Based on user’s role in the organization
- Admin assigns access by role/group (e.g., Windows groups)

#### Rule-Based Access Control
- Access determined by system-enforced rules (not users)
- Rules tied to the object → system checks ACLs

#### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Access based on multiple criteria:
  - Resource info, IP address, time of day, desired action, etc.

##### Time-of-Day Restrictions
- Restrict access during specific times/days  
  Example: Room network inaccessible between midnight and 6 AM

---

### Least Privilege
- Rights and permissions should be **minimum required**
- All user accounts limited
- Apps should run with minimal privileges
- No administrative rights unless necessary

---

### Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

#### Implementations
- Biometrics
- Hard/soft tokens
- Security keys

#### Factors
- **Something you know**: password, PIN
- **Something you have**: smart card, hardware/software tokens, SMS code
- **Something you are**: biometrics (fingerprint, iris)
- **Somewhere you are**: location/IP address (usually IPv4)

---

### Password Concepts
- **Best practices**
  - Length: at least 8 characters
  - Complexity
  - No reuse
  - Expiration (30/60/90 days)
  - Age (password valid only for set time)
- **Password managers**
  - Store all passwords in one encrypted DB
  - Protected with MFA
  - Some are built into browsers
- **Passwordless authentication**
  - Example: facial recognition, security key

---

### Privileged Access Management (PAM)

#### Just-in-Time Permissions
- Grant admin access for a limited time
- Central system approves/denies based on policies

#### Password Vaulting
- Primary credentials stored in a secure vault
- Controls who can access them
- Accounts are temporary:
  - Just-in-time creates time-limited accounts
  - Admin receives **ephemeral credentials**
  - Primary passwords never revealed
  - Credentials used once, then deleted
