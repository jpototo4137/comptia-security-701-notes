###### Security Control Categories & Functional Types - Cheatsheet  

*Keywords but context matters! (can fit into multiple types)*  

---

**Managerial:**  
Policies & Procedures ‚Üí planning & assessment methods  

**Technical:**  
Hardware/software ‚Üí tech  

**Operational** (new in SY0-701):  
Ensure day-to-day operations by **people** (not systems)  

**Physical:**  
Facility / real-world objects ‚Üí tangible (touchable)  

---

- **Deterrent** (discourage/violation): warning sign, visibility, perception  
- **Preventive** (stop): access control, authentication, firewall, encryption  
- **Directive** (direct, confine/control): policy, procedure, standard, guideline  
- **Detective** (discover/detect): monitoring, audit, logging, alert  
- **Corrective** (restore): backup, restore, incident response, patching  
- **Compensating** (provide options): alternative, backup, redundancy

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Service & Deployment Models ‚Äì Cheatsheet

---

#### Cloud Service Models  
_(Ranked by control: high ‚Üí low)_

| Model | User Responsibility | CSP Responsibility | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|-------|
| **IaaS**<br>(Infrastructure as a Service) | VMs, virtual networks, guest OS security | Physical hardware, network, storage, virtualization | ‚úÖ Most control, most complex |
| **PaaS**<br>(Platform as a Service) | App configuration & logic | OS, runtime, middleware, infrastructure | ‚öôÔ∏è Easier, but limited control |
| **SaaS**<br>(Software as a Service) | Access control, feature settings, data recovery | Everything else (infra, app, availability) | üßº Simplest, least control |

---

#### Shared Responsibility Model (User vs. Cloud Provider)

- **IaaS** ‚Üí You manage: OS, data, app config  
- **PaaS** ‚Üí You manage: app config & data  
- **SaaS** ‚Üí You manage: access & some settings  
- Everything else is the **Cloud Service Provider (CSP)**‚Äôs job

Tip: Responsibility shifts **more to the CSP** as you go from IaaS ‚Üí SaaS.

---

#### Cloud Deployment Models

| Model | Description | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Public Cloud** | Entirely on provider's hardware | Scalable, no maintenance, cost-efficient |
| **Private Cloud** | Hosted on-premises or for one org | Compliance, legacy systems |
| **Hybrid Cloud** | Mix of public + private | Gradual migration, flexibility |
| **Community Cloud** | Shared among related orgs | Same sector, shared security goals |
| **Multi-Cloud** | Uses multiple public cloud providers | Cost control, vendor flexibility (more complex) |

---
#### Vuln Management

üîπ SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
	‚Ä¢	When: during development phase (before deployment).
	‚Ä¢	Why: to catch coding flaws early ‚Üí buffer overflows, injections.
	‚Ä¢	Scenario keyword: ‚Äúdeveloper needs to check code for vulnerabilities before running it‚Äù ‚Üí use SAST.
	‚Ä¢	Limit: can‚Äôt test runtime issues (auth, crypto). Produces false positives.

‚∏ª

üîπ Fuzzing (Dynamic Analysis)
	‚Ä¢	When: during testing phase, after code compiles and runs.
	‚Ä¢	Why: test how the application reacts to unexpected/random inputs.
	‚Ä¢	Scenario keyword: ‚Äúlooking for crashes, errors, exceptions‚Äù ‚Üí fuzzing.
	‚Ä¢	Limit: resource heavy, not efficient for every scenario.

‚∏ª

üîπ Package Monitoring
	‚Ä¢	When: during software acquisition and deployment.
	‚Ä¢	Why: to ensure downloaded packages (libraries, updates, dependencies) are from trusted sources and contain no hidden malware/vulnerabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Scenario keyword: ‚Äúdeveloper installs library from untrusted repo‚Äù ‚Üí check with package monitoring.
	‚Ä¢	Limit: Doesn‚Äôt test the code, only verifies source integrity.

‚∏ª

üîπ Penetration Testing
	‚Ä¢	When: after systems are deployed, in production environments (not just dev/test).
	‚Ä¢	Why: simulate real attacker behavior to confirm exploitable vulnerabilities.
	‚Ä¢	Scenario keyword: ‚Äúorganization must validate if a vulnerability can be exploited‚Äù ‚Üí pentest.
	‚Ä¢	Notes:
	‚Ä¢	Required by compliance (PCI DSS, HIPAA).
	‚Ä¢	Rules of engagement define scope.
	‚Ä¢	Risks: may cause DoS/data loss.

# Domain 5.3 ‚Äì Key Terms & Exam Indicators

## Vendor Assessment Methods

| Term | Definition | Scenario/Indicator (Exam) | Keywords/Triggers |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| **Pentest** | Simulated cyberattack against vendor system | You need to verify vendor security from the **outside attacker‚Äôs view** | "Simulate attack", "test security posture" |
| **Right-to-Audit Clause** | Contract clause allowing you to audit vendor‚Äôs practices | Included in contracts for oversight | "Contract clause", "audit vendor" |
| **Evidence of Internal Audits** | Vendor provides proof they audit themselves | You ask vendor for logs/reports | "Proof of audits", "internal security checks" |
| **Independent Assessments** | External auditor reviews vendor | CSP or vendor provides **SOC 2 / ISO 27001** | "External audit", "third-party report" |
| **Supply Chain Analysis** | Check security of **vendors + subcontractors** | Risks may come from 3rd-party suppliers | "Subcontractor", "ecosystem", "vendor chain" |

---

## Right-to-Audit (Detailed)

- Customers may **audit vendors** via **contract clauses**.  
- **BUT**: You cannot audit **public CSPs** (AWS, Azure, GCP). Instead ‚Üí use **independent attestation reports**.  

**Exam keywords**:  
- "Right-to-audit clause" = **private vendors**.  
- "Cloud vendor" = **look for SOC 2 / ISO 27001**.  

---

## Supply Chain Analysis ‚Äì Exam Indicators

| Method | Definition | Exam Trigger |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **On-Site Assessment** | Visit vendor, interview staff | "Visit facility", "observe processes" |
| **Document Exchange & Review** | Review policies/docs | "Review vendor policies", "doc exchange" |
| **Policy Review** | Request official security procedures | "Review security policies" |
| **Third-Party Audit** | External audit firm provides report | "Independent verification", "SOC 2 / ISO" |

---

## Vendor Selection

### Due Diligence (Easy Analogy)
- **Why is it called this?** ‚Üí "Due" = what you **must** do. "Diligence" = careful research.  
- **Definition**: Research/checks you do **before signing contract**.  
- **Scenario**: Before hiring vendor, you check their **financials, reputation, compliance, security**.  
- **Exam keyword**: "Before signing", "review vendor financial health", "vendor viability".  

### Due Care
- **Actions taken** after due diligence.  
- Example: If due diligence shows weak security ‚Üí due care = adding contract clauses or rejecting them.  

---

### Conflicts of Interest
- **Financial**: Employee has stake in vendor (biased decision).  
- **Bribes/Kickbacks**: Inflated contracts, relaxed quality standards.  
- **Professional**: Pre-existing personal ties or "revolving door" employment.  

**Exam keywords**:  
- "Employee‚Äôs brother owns vendor" ‚Üí **Conflict of Interest**.  
- "Former employee joins vendor" ‚Üí **Revolving door**.  

---

## Agreement Types

| Agreement | Definition | Exam Scenario/Indicator | Keywords |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|----------|
| **SLA (Service-Level Agreement)** | Contract defining uptime/downtime, penalties | Vendor promises uptime or response times | "Downtime", "penalties", "performance expectations" |
| **MOU (Memorandum of Understanding)** | Non-binding formal agreement | Two parties intend to cooperate but not legally bound | "Intent", "not legally enforceable" |
| **MOA (Memorandum of Agreement)** | Binding contract (legal) | Legal obligations, enforceable | "Legal agreement", "binding contract" |
| **MSA (Master Service Agreement)** | Governs overall, ongoing vendor relationship | Used with vendors you‚Äôll work with repeatedly | "Ongoing", "general terms", "before SOW" |
| **SOW (Statement of Work)** | Specific deliverables/project agreement | Defines tasks, timelines, deliverables | "Specific project", "after MSA" |
| **NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)** | Protects confidential info | Vendor/employee must not share secrets | "Confidentiality", "trade secrets" |
| **BPA (Business Partnership Agreement)** | Partnership for profit between entities | Business venture partnerships | "Profit-sharing", "partnership" |

---

# ‚ú® Big Picture (Exam Tips)
- **Due diligence** ‚Üí before contract (research).  
- **Due care** ‚Üí after contract (actions).  
- **Right-to-audit** ‚Üí vendors, **not CSPs**.  
- **Supply chain** ‚Üí always think of **subcontractor risk**.  
- Agreement type questions are often **keyword traps**:  
  - SLA = uptime/downtime  
  - MOU = informal, not binding  
  - MOA = binding  
  - MSA = ongoing  
  - SOW = specific project  
  - NDA = confidentiality  
  - BPA = partnership/profit
