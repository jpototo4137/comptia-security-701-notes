> **Vulnerability Life Cycle**  
> **Identification → Analysis → Response → Validation → Reporting**

## Identification Methods

### SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- Detects: **buffer overflows, database injections**  
- Cannot detect: **auth security, insecure cryptography**  
- Must verify findings → **false positives** common  

### Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing)
- Send random input to app → watch for **crash, errors, exceptions**  
- Types: fault-injection, robustness, syntax, negative testing  
- **Fuzzing engines & frameworks**:  
  - Platform or language specific  
  - **Resource heavy** (CPU, time) → many use probability tests  
  - Example: **CERT Basic Fuzzing Framework (BFF)**  

### Package Monitoring
- Confirm **legitimacy** of packages:  
  - Trusted source  
  - No added malware / vulnerabilities  
  - Contents verified  

### Threat Intelligence
#### OSINT (Open-source Intelligence)
- Public sources: Internet, social media, govt data, reports  

#### Proprietary / Third-Party
- Purchased intelligence services  
- Correlate threat data across sources  
- Automated prevention workflows  

#### Information-Sharing Orgs
- Public intel (sometimes classified)  
- Private intel (industry groups, e.g. **Cyber Threat Alliance**)  
  - Members share validated, scored threat data  

#### Dark Web Intelligence
- Monitor hacker forums/markets:  
  - Tools/techniques, credit card sales, stolen acc/pw  
  - Good for checking if your org is being targeted  

### Penetration Testing
- Simulates **real attack** (unlike vuln scan which only detects)  
- Often compliance mandated  

**Cautions**  
- May cause **DoS / data loss** if misused  
- Exploits: brute-force, social engineering, injection, buffer overflow  

#### Rules of Engagement
- Defines **scope & purpose**:  
  - Testing type (internal, external, physical, after hours)  
  - Rules (IP ranges, handling sensitive info, in/out-of-scope devices)  

#### Process
- **Initial exploitation** → entry point  
- **Lateral movement** → jump between systems  
- **Persistence** → backdoors, default pw changes, user creation  
- **Pivot point** → compromised system as proxy  

#### Responsible Disclosure
- Report vulnerabilities → vendor fixes  
- **Bug bounty programs** incentivize disclosure

## Analysis

### False Positives vs False Negatives
- **False positive** → flagged vuln doesn’t exist  
- **False negative** → vuln exists but wasn’t detected  
- Keep tools updated (signatures, DB).  

### Prioritization
- **Severity ranking**: High > Medium > Low  
- **CVSS** → score 0–10 (v2 vs v3.x differences)  
- **CVE** → known vulnerabilities (e.g. CVE-2020-1889)  
  - Apps, web apps, network misconfigs  

### Exposure Factor
- % impact: e.g. DDoS = 50% service loss, buffer overflow = 100% loss  

### Environmental Variables
- Internal vs external, public vs test environment  
- Patching frequency depends on user type, revenue apps  

### Org Impact & Risk Tolerance
- Org type influences severity  
- Risk tolerance defines **patch timing**  
- Testing introduces exposure window  

**Cheatsheet – Analysis**

| **Concept** | **Definition** | **Exam Trap** |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| False Positive | Vuln flagged but not real | Over-reporting |
| False Negative | Vuln exists but missed | Blind spot |
| CVSS | Quantitative 0–10 score | Version v2 vs v3 |
| CVE | Specific vuln ID | Applies across scans |
| Exposure Factor | % service loss | 50% vs 100% |
| Risk Tolerance | Patch timing acceptable | Depends on severity |

## Vulnerability Response & Remediation

### Patching
- **Most common mitigation**  
- Scheduled (monthly, quarterly)  
- Unscheduled (zero-day, urgent)  

### Insurance
- Cyber coverage may include: lost revenue, data recovery, phishing losses, privacy lawsuits  
- Not comprehensive; ransomware coverage growing  

### Segmentation
- Limit exploit scope  
- **Air gap** → if can’t patch, disconnect from world  
- Internal **NGFWs**: block traffic, detect malicious flows  

### Physical vs Logical Segmentation
- **Physical** → separate devices/infrastructure  
- **Logical (VLANs)** → segmented on same device, requires router (L3) to communicate  

### Compensating Controls
- Alternative measures when patch unavailable:  
  - Disable service  
  - Revoke access  
  - Limit external use  
  - Modify internal controls, software firewalls  

**Cheatsheet – Response**

| **Technique** | **Purpose** | **Exam Trap** |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|
| Patching | Fix vuln directly | Zero-day urgent |
| Insurance | Offset financial loss | Limited coverage |
| Segmentation | Limit attack scope | VLANs need L3 device |
| Air Gap | Isolation when no patch | ICS/SCADA |
| Comp Controls | Temporary protection | Disable service |

## Validation of Remediation

### Exceptions & Exemptions
- Balance between service availability vs patching risk  
- Some vulns less severe → delayed fixes  

### Validation Process
- Confirm patch effectiveness  
- Verify all vulnerable systems patched  
- **Rescan** after patch  
- **Audit & verification**  

---

## Reporting
- Continuous checks needed → vulns always emerging  
- **Automation essential** (manual too time-consuming)  
- Reporting includes:  
  - # identified vulns  
  - Patched vs unpatched systems  
  - New threat notifications  
  - Errors, exceptions, exemptions

## Monitoring Computing Resources

### Systems
- **Authentication** → logins from strange places  
- **Server monitoring** → service activities, backups, software versions  

### Applications
- **Availability** → uptime & response times  
- **Data transfers** → spikes or drops in traffic  
- **Security notifications** → from devs/vendors  

### Infrastructure
- **Remote access systems** → employees, vendors, guests  
- **Firewall/IPS reports** → attack types & frequency  

**Cheatsheet – Computing Resources**

| **Area** | **What to Monitor** | **Why** |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| Systems | Logins, backups, versions | Detect anomalies |

---

## Activities

### Log Aggregation
- **SIEM/SEM** → central log consolidation (servers, firewalls, VPNs, SANs, cloud)  
- **Centralized reporting**  
- **Correlation across systems** → auth, app access, data transfer monitoring  

### Alerting
- Real-time notification (e.g., large file transfers, repeated login failures)  
- **Actionable data** → quick response  
- Delivery methods: SMS, email, console, SOC  

### Scanning
- Continuous scan of: OS type/versions, drivers, anomalies  

### Reporting
- **Actionable reports** → compliance status, outdated OS, devices  
- **Ad hoc analysis** (“what-if” scenarios, future predictions)  

### Archiving
- Breach identification average: ~9 months  
- May be mandated by law/org requirements  

### Alert Response & Remediation
- **Quarantine** → isolate suspected system  
- **Alert tuning** → balance between false positives & false negatives  

**Cheatsheet – Monitoring Activities**

| **Activity** | **Purpose** | **Notes** |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| Aggregation | Collect logs centrally | SIEM |

## Security Tools

### SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)
- Managed by **NIST**  
- Shared between tools → config compliance, vuln detection  
- **Automation**: ongoing monitoring, alerting, remediation  
- Useful in large environments  

### Benchmarks
- Best practice security configs (e.g. **CIS Benchmarks**)  
- Baseline = bare minimum  

### Agents vs Agentless
- **Agents**:  
  - Installed software  
  - Real-time monitoring & notifications  
  - Must be maintained & updated  
- **Agentless**:  
  - One-time/on-demand checks  
  - No ongoing monitoring  
  - No alerts if not running  

### SIEM (Security Information & Event Management)
- Logs security events & alerts  
- Real-time log collection & aggregation  
- Long-term storage & reporting  
- **Correlation** → link diverse data types  
- **Forensics** → detailed post-event analysis  

### Antivirus & Anti-malware
- **Antivirus** → originally focused on viruses (trojans, worms, macros)  
- **Anti-malware** → broader category (spyware, ransomware, fileless)  
- Modern tools = combined capabilities  

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Prevent **data leakage** before attacker access  
- Multi-solution approach: endpoint clients + cloud-based (email, storage, collaboration)  

### SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
- Uses **MIB (Management Information Base)** + OIDs  
- **Polling** over UDP/161 → request device stats  
- Creates **historical performance graphs**  
- **SNMP traps** over UDP/162:  
  - Set thresholds → device sends trap when exceeded  

### NetFlow
- **Probe + collector** model  
- Probe watches comms → summary sent to collector  
- Used for network traffic analysis  

### Vulnerability Scanners
- Minimally invasive (unlike pentests)  
- Port scans, system identification  
- Test both **internal and external**  

**Cheatsheet – Security Tools**

| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Exam Trap** |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| SCAP | Config compliance automation | NIST-managed |
| Benchmarks | Security baselines (CIS) | Bare minimum |
| Agent | Detailed real-time monitoring | Needs maintenance |
| Agentless | One-time checks | No ongoing alerts |
