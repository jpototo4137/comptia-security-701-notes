## Privileged Access Management (PAM)
| Concept | What it is | When to use | Exam scenario |
|---------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Just-in-Time Access** | Temporary admin rights | Admin tasks, reduce attack surface | Q: Admin gets temp rights for 1 hour ‚Äì which concept? |
| **Password Vaulting** | Store root/admin creds in vault | High-security IT ops | Q: Which stores and controls access to privileged accounts? |
| **Ephemeral Credentials** | Disposable credentials | Cloud access, temp accounts | Q: Admin gets creds valid for one session ‚Äì which? |


üîë Identity & Access Management (IAM)

What it is: The whole system of who you are (identity) and what you can do (access).
	‚Ä¢	When to use: Always, in any org with employees, devices, or apps.
	‚Ä¢	Why: Without IAM, everyone could log in as ‚Äúadmin‚Äù ‚Üí chaos.
	‚Ä¢	Big picture analogy: Like a building with security badges. IAM decides who gets a badge, what doors it opens, and when it expires.
	‚Ä¢	Exam tip: Questions about provisioning accounts, SSO, authentication ‚Üí always IAM.

‚∏ª

üîê Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

What it is: Using more than one way to prove you are you (password + phone code, fingerprint + smart card, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	When to use: Sensitive accounts (admins, VPN, remote workers, banking, cloud).
	‚Ä¢	Why: Passwords leak. MFA stops attackers even if they stole your password.
	‚Ä¢	Big picture analogy: Like needing both your apartment key and a fingerprint scanner to enter.
	‚Ä¢	Exam tip: If scenario says ‚Äúreduce password attacks‚Äù or ‚Äúprevent stolen password misuse‚Äù ‚Üí Answer is MFA.

‚∏ª

üëë Privileged Access Management (PAM)

What it is: Special handling of admin accounts (root, domain admin).
	‚Ä¢	When to use: For IT staff, cloud admins, or anyone with high-level rights.
	‚Ä¢	Why: If an admin account is hacked, attacker owns everything. PAM reduces risk by:
	‚Ä¢	Giving admins only temporary rights (Just-in-Time).
	‚Ä¢	Storing passwords in vaults (no one sees them).
	‚Ä¢	Using ephemeral credentials (self-destruct after use).
	‚Ä¢	Big picture analogy: Like checking out the master key to a building only for 1 hour, then the key melts away.
	‚Ä¢	Exam tip: If scenario says ‚Äúlimit exposure of admin accounts‚Äù or ‚Äútemporary elevated rights‚Äù ‚Üí Answer is PAM.

üóÇÔ∏è Access Control Models

These are philosophies for ‚Äúwho can access what.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	MAC (Mandatory): Based on clearance labels. Think military.
	‚Ä¢	DAC (Discretionary): Owner decides. Think Windows folder ‚Äúshare‚Äù button.
	‚Ä¢	RBAC (Role-Based): Based on your job title/role. Think ‚ÄúHR group has HR folder access‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Rule-Based: Based on system rules. Think firewalls, ACLs.
	‚Ä¢	ABAC (Attribute-Based): Based on many attributes (location, device, time). Think cloud apps.
	‚Ä¢	Exam tip:
	‚Ä¢	Military/clearance? ‚Üí MAC
	‚Ä¢	File owner grants access? ‚Üí DAC
	‚Ä¢	Groups/jobs? ‚Üí RBAC
	‚Ä¢	If/else rules? ‚Üí Rule-based
	‚Ä¢	Cloud fine-grained? ‚Üí ABAC

‚∏ª

üì° LDAP, SAML, OAuth, OpenID Connect (the ones confusing you)

Think of these as languages/protocols different apps use to talk about ‚Äúwho you are‚Äù:
	‚Ä¢	LDAP (Directory phonebook):
	‚Ä¢	Like a company‚Äôs phonebook ‚Üí stores users, passwords, groups.
	‚Ä¢	Example: When you log into Windows domain, it checks LDAP.
	‚Ä¢	Exam tip: If scenario says ‚Äúquery user database‚Äù ‚Üí LDAP.
	‚Ä¢	SAML (Enterprise SSO ticket):
	‚Ä¢	XML-based ‚Äúpassport‚Äù for web apps.
	‚Ä¢	Example: You log into your company portal ‚Üí click Salesforce ‚Üí already logged in.
	‚Ä¢	Exam tip: If scenario says ‚Äúweb SSO with a standard‚Äù ‚Üí SAML.
	‚Ä¢	OAuth (Delegated permission):
	‚Ä¢	Lets one app act on your behalf without sharing your password.
	‚Ä¢	Example: You let a fitness app post to your Twitter without giving it your Twitter password.
	‚Ä¢	Exam tip: If scenario says ‚Äúgrant access without sharing creds‚Äù ‚Üí OAuth.
	‚Ä¢	OpenID Connect (Who you are, built on OAuth):
	‚Ä¢	Adds authentication (identity) on top of OAuth.
	‚Ä¢	Example: ‚ÄúSign in with Google.‚Äù OAuth allows access; OpenID proves you are really you.
	‚Ä¢	Exam tip: If scenario says ‚Äúauthentication on top of OAuth‚Äù ‚Üí OpenID Connect.

‚∏ª

üìù TL;DR Exam Strategy
	‚Ä¢	IAM = Who gets what identity & access (the whole framework).
	‚Ä¢	MFA = Stop password-only hacks.
	‚Ä¢	PAM = Protect admin/root accounts.
	‚Ä¢	Access models = Philosophies (MAC, DAC, RBAC, ABAC).
	‚Ä¢	LDAP/SAML/OAuth/OIDC = Protocols that enable IAM in real life.
