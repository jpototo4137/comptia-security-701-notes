## Access Control Models

| Model | Description | Analogy | When to Use | Exam Scenario |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **MAC** | Mandatory Access Control: Labels + clearance levels. | Military “Top Secret” clearance. | Gov/military, highly secure data. | “User cannot change perms, system enforces labels.” |
| **DAC** | Discretionary Access Control: Owner decides who gets access. | Windows folder “Right click → Share.” | Most common in OS (Windows, Unix). | “File owner grants or changes permissions.” |
| **RBAC** | Role-Based Access Control: Permissions tied to roles/groups. | HR group auto gets HR docs. | Large orgs, scalability. | “Finance team gets finance system.” |
| **Rule-based** | System-enforced rules (ACLs, firewall-like). | If/else conditions. | Network/firewall style enforcement. | “Access only if time=9AM–5PM.” |
| **ABAC** | Attribute-Based Access Control: Multiple factors (role, IP, time, location). | Cloud fine-grained policy. | Modern cloud & zero trust. | “User must be in HR role, using corp IP, during work hours.” |

# 🔑 Identity and Access Management (IAM) Big Picture Cheat Sheet

---

## 🚀 IAM (Identity & Access Management)
- **What:** Framework for identities + access.  
- **When to use:** Always, any org with employees/devices/apps.  
- **Why:** Prevents chaos (no “everyone is admin”).  
- **Analogy:** Security badges in a building.  
- **Exam clue:** Provisioning, SSO, account lifecycle → **IAM**.

---

## 🔐 MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- **What:** More than 1 proof of identity (password + code, fingerprint + card).  
- **When to use:** Sensitive accounts (admins, VPN, banking, cloud).  
- **Why:** Stops stolen password attacks.  
- **Analogy:** Apartment key + fingerprint scanner.  
- **Exam clue:** Scenario about “reduce password attacks” → **MFA**.

---

## 👑 PAM (Privileged Access Management)
- **What:** Special handling for **admin/root** accounts.  
- **When to use:** IT staff, cloud admins, privileged users.  
- **Why:** If admin hacked → attacker owns everything.  
- **Features:**  
  - Just-in-Time (temporary rights)  
  - Vaulting (store admin creds, no one sees them)  
  - Ephemeral creds (self-destruct after use)  
- **Analogy:** Master key melts after 1 hr use.  
- **Exam clue:** “Temporary elevated rights / admin account risk” → **PAM**.

---

## 🗂️ Access Control Models
| Model | Description | Analogy | Exam Scenario |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **MAC** | Mandatory labels & clearance | Military clearance | “Top Secret file” |
| **DAC** | Owner decides access | Windows folder “Share” | “File owner gives perms” |
| **RBAC** | Based on role/job group | HR group gets HR files | “Finance team access” |
| **Rule-based** | System-enforced rules | Firewall ACLs | “If/else conditions” |
| **ABAC** | Multi-criteria (location, IP, time) | Cloud fine-grained | “Time-based or location-based access” |

---

## 📡 IAM Protocols & Standards

| Protocol/Standard | What it does | Analogy | When/Exam use |
|-------------------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **LDAP** | Directory protocol for users/groups | Company phonebook | “Query user DB” |
| **SAML** | Web SSO standard (XML) | Passport for web apps | “Enterprise SSO” |
| **OAuth** | Delegated access (authorization) | Giving valet keys | “Grant access without password” |
| **OpenID Connect** | Identity/auth on top of OAuth | “Sign in with Google” | “Auth built on OAuth” |

---

# 📝 TL;DR Exam Strategy
- **IAM** = Whole framework (accounts, lifecycle, SSO).  
- **MFA** = Stop password-only hacks.  
- **PAM** = Protect admin/root accounts.  
- **Access models** = Philosophies (MAC, DAC, RBAC, ABAC).  
- **LDAP/SAML/OAuth/OIDC** = Protocols that *make IAM work in real life*.


## 4.7 Automation and Orchestration

### 🔹 Scripting & Automation

**Benefits / Pros**
- Automate & orchestrate repetitive security tasks  
- Speed → faster reaction to incidents  
- Save time → workforce multiplier (scripts run 24/7)  
- Enforce baselines (e.g., missing patch auto-installed)  
- Consistency → standardized infrastructure configs (firewall rules, IP configs, etc.)  
- Secure scaling (cloud/VMs auto-hardened when deployed)  
- Improves employee retention → less burnout from repetitive tasks  

---

### 📌 Common Use Cases

| Use Case | What It Does | Security Value | Exam Relevance |
|----------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **User & Resource Provisioning** | Auto create/remove accounts during onboarding/offboarding | Prevents orphaned accounts (insider threat) | *“Automate account provisioning” → answer is automation/orchestration* |
| **Guard Rails** | Automated checks/validations for configs | Prevents misconfigurations | *“Automated policy validation” → guard rails* |
| **Security Groups** | Assign/remove group access, constant audits | Enforces least privilege | *“Auto group assignment” → automation* |
| **Ticket Creation** | Auto-generate helpdesk/security tickets | Faster incident tracking | SIEM + SOAR combo in practice |
| **Escalation** | Auto correct issues before human involvement | Saves analyst time | *“Scripted escalation before analyst review”* |
| **Controlling Services/Access** | Enable/disable services automatically | Reduces attack surface | E.g., auto-disable unused ports |
| **Continuous Integration / Testing** | Automate security testing during build pipelines (CI/CD) | DevSecOps integration | Exam may mention “secure CI/CD pipeline” |
| **API Integration** | Connect tools (SIEM, SOAR, NAC, firewalls) via APIs | Orchestration across multiple platforms | *Keyword: API-driven automation* |


- **Guard rails**: 
are used by application developers to provide a set of
automated validations to user input and behavior. Guard rails are not used
by the help desk team

- **Escalation**: 
Automation can recognize security events and escalate a security-related
ticket to the incident response team without any additional human
interaction.

### Automation vs Orchestration vs SOAR

| Concept | What It Means | Scope | Example | Exam Scenario |
|---------|---------------|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Automation** | Single task executed by a script/tool | Narrow, task-level | Auto-disable unused account | “System auto-applies patches without admin input” |
| **Orchestration** | Linking multiple automated tasks across systems | Broader, workflow-level | Auto-create account → assign groups → send ticket → configure access | “Coordinated response across IAM, SIEM, firewall” |
| **SOAR** (Security Orchestration, Automation & Response) | Platform that combines orchestration + automation + case management | Enterprise-wide | SIEM alert → SOAR auto-triggers block on firewall → opens ticket | “Integrates SIEM alerts with automated remediation” |

Big Picture:
	•	Automation = “one button does one thing.”
	•	Orchestration = “connect multiple buttons together into a flow.”
	•	SOAR = “full platform for orchestration + automation + incident response.”

On the exam, if they ask about “single repetitive task” → Automation.
If it’s “end-to-end process across multiple tools” → Orchestration.
If it’s “security alerts auto-handled and tracked” → SOAR.

### ⚠️ Scripting Considerations

| Concern | Meaning | Risk |
|---------|---------|------|
| **Complexity** | Scripts become hard to manage | More prone to bugs |
| **Cost** | Development & maintenance overhead | Budget issues |
| **Single Point of Failure** | If automation breaks, critical tasks stop | Reliability risk |
| **Technical Debt** | Old scripts not updated over time | Security holes |
| **Ongoing Supportability** | Needs continuous updates | Long-term management load |

---

### Big Picture
- **Automation = do tasks faster/consistent**  
- **Orchestration = link multiple systems/tools together via automation** (like SOAR + APIs).  
- Together, they:  
  - Reduce human error  
  - Speed up incident response  
  - Free humans for analysis, not repetitive work
 

# 4.8 Incident Response  

## Incident Response Process (NIST SP 800-61)  

1. **Preparation**  
   - Policies, plans, playbooks, tools  
   - Training staff for incidents  

2. **Detection & Analysis**  
   - Identify suspicious activity (logs, alerts, anomalies)  
   - Confirm whether it’s an actual incident  

3. **Containment, Eradication & Recovery**  
   - **Containment**: prevent spread (segmentation, disable accounts)  
   - **Eradication**: remove malware, disable breached accounts, fix vulnerabilities  
   - **Recovery**: restore systems, rebuild from clean backups  

4. **Lessons Learned**  
   - Post-incident review  
   - What went wrong, what worked well  
   - Update training & playbooks  

---

## Incident Planning  

| Concept              | Description | Example | Exam Tip |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Training** | Staff must be prepared to follow IR plan | Phishing awareness, incident playbooks | Expect scenario: *“Which step ensures staff knows what to do during IR?”* |
| **Tabletop Exercise** | Discussion-based, walk through response | “What if ransomware hit our file server?” | Low cost, good for logistics |
| **Simulation** | Hands-on, real-time mock attack | Red team vs Blue team exercise | More realistic, resource heavy |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Identify *true* cause of incident | Patch missing → exploit occurred | Exam Q: “What analysis identifies ultimate cause?” |
| **Threat Hunting** | Proactive search for attackers | Look for unusual logins, beaconing | Needed because threat intel is **reactive** |

---

## Digital Forensics  

**Goal:** Collect, preserve, and analyze evidence from incidents  

### Core Principles  
- **RFC 3227** – Evidence Collection best practices  
- **Process:** Acquisition → Analysis → Reporting  

### Key Forensic Concepts  

| Term | Description | Example | Exam Tip |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Legal Hold** | Preserve data for litigation, initiated by legal | Custodian told not to delete emails | Triggered by legal counsel |
| **Chain of Custody** | Document evidence handling to maintain integrity | Hashing a hard drive before transfer | Integrity check, no tampering |
| **Acquisition** | Collect evidence (disk, RAM, logs, snapshots) | Capture volatile memory first | Order of volatility is exam favorite |
| **Preservation** | Secure storage and handling of evidence | Sealed and tagged evidence drive | Prevents loss or corruption |
| **Reporting** | Summarize findings, explain methodology | IR summary for management | Must be clear and defensible |
| **E-Discovery** | Legal process to collect/review electronic docs | Search emails in fraud case | Often paired with forensics |

---

## Quick Comparisons  

### Tabletop vs Simulation  

| Type | Approach | Cost | Use Case |
|------|----------|------|----------|
| **Tabletop** | Discussion, “what-if” scenarios | Low | Plan review & logistics |
| **Simulation** | Realistic, hands-on attack | High | Full readiness test |

---

### Legal Hold vs Chain of Custody  

| Concept | Purpose | Who Initiates | Exam Keyword |
|---------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| **Legal Hold** | Preserve data for legal reasons | Legal Counsel | Litigation trigger |
| **Chain of Custody** | Maintain integrity of evidence | Security/Forensic Team | Integrity, tampering |

---

### Order of Volatility (Exam Must-Know)  
1. CPU registers, cache  
2. RAM  
3. Network traffic  
4. Disk  
5. Backups/archives  

---

**Exam Angle:**  
- Questions will often ask: *“What’s the FIRST step after detecting malware?”* → **Containment**  
- Or: *“Which evidence should be collected first?”* → **RAM (order of volatility)**  
- Or: *“Legal team requires preservation of data for court, what’s this called?”* → **Legal Hold**
